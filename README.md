## Program Functions

### Core Functions

#### `initialize`
Initialize the contract with an owner account. This sets up the contract owner who has special privileges.

#### `register_merchant`
Register a new merchant with location coordinates and metadata URI. If coordinates are provided (non-zero), the merchant is automatically verified and receives both registration and verification rewards.

#### `register_user`
Register a new user account in the system. Users receive registration rewards and can earn transaction rewards.

#### `verify_merchant`
Verify an existing merchant's location by updating their coordinates. This function can only be called on unverified merchants and awards verification rewards.

#### `increment_tx_count`
Increment transaction count for both merchant and user accounts (only callable by contract owner). This function:
- Rewards both merchant and user with transaction tokens
- Automatically awards OG badge to merchants after 10 transactions
- Includes bonus OG badge reward for qualifying merchants

#### `update_merchant_nft_status`
Update NFT minting status for merchants (only callable by contract owner). This tracks whether merchants have minted their verification and/or OG NFTs.
