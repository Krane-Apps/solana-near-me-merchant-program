# Solana Near Me Merchant Program

**Solana Near Me** is the first Seeker mobile app that helps you find Solana merchants and ATMs near you. Built 100% for the Solana ecosystem, with Solana Pay, Seeker Wallet, and Token rewards and NFTs are integrated. It's **On-Chain Local Commerce** now possible with help of Solana Sekker Devices.

# Problem We Solve**
Solana is fast, cheap, and scalable â€” but without local visibility, it's underused in the real world. Solana Near Me gives every Seeker holder a way to earn by turning Seeker devices into merchant wallets and a proof-of-location device.

## What This Contract Does

The Solana Near Me Merchant Program manages Merchant Registration, Location Verification, and Token Reward System for local businesses accepting SOL payments.

### NFT Badges
Merchants can earn exclusive NFT badges:

| **Verified Location Badge** | **OG Merchants** |
| Legitimate businesses with confirmed locations | Legendary status merchants with high transactions and volume |
